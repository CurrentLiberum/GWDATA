# Deploying Bootstrap

We'll learn the basics of the [French Embassy Hackathon Series: Ed Hack 2017 site](http://www.frenchedhack.com/). 

## Bootstrap

The above site is _probably_ the closest one could come to making a website with as few of edits to a Bootstrap template as possible. The site is a near clone of Bootstrap's [Landing Page Theme](https://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/landing-page/).

Credits and thanks to the creators of the template [Mark Otto](https://twitter.com/mdo) and [Jacob Thorton](https://twitter.com/fat). Thanks to [David Miller](http://davidmiller.io/) of [Blackrock Digital](http://blackrockdigital.io/) for maintaining [Start Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/).
